## Content

CT scans of glass fiber reinforced polymers are used to determine the fiber volume content (FVC) through image processing. However, in the case of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP), the contrast between the polymer matrix existing of C-atoms and the carbon fibers existing of C-atoms is very low. Additionally, as carbon fibers have a small diameter of 5-7 Âµm, the resolution has to be high in order to resolve the fibers. Both effects lead to noisy images. As conventional thresholding methods struggle to reliably differentiate between matrix and fibers, the authors tested a convolutional neural network for the FVC determination from 3D CT images. The model directly takes the 3D CT scans and the experimentally measured FVC as an input and outputs one single value as predicted FVC for a specific scan and hence specimen. The network architecture can be seen below:
